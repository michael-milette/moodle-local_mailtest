# Basic Overview

The eMailTest module for Moodle allows administrators to test Moodle's email system. A trace of the SMTP dialogue will be displayed if the email message cannot be sent for any reason.

Once the test email has been sent, you will need to check your email in-box to confirm that the email message was successfully delivered. This plugin will not do that for you.

# FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I get a 500 server error when I use eMailTest?

This plugin has been extensively tested and used on hundreds of sites. If you are getting this error, it is likely that you have a file owner/group permissions issue on your server which needs to be resolved.

### Why does it say that Moodle sent the test message successfully yet I did not receive the email?

This could be due to a number of reasons including but not limited to:

* Incorrect PHP Mail settings in your php.ini file (if you have not configured Moodle's SMTP settings).
* You may have an anti-virus or firewall blocking email communications.
* The mail server receiving your email may be discarding emails received from your site.
* The test email may be blocked by anti-spam filters. Check your junk mail folder.

### How do I find out the correct email settings I should be using?

Contact your network administrator or your web hosting provider. These are typically the same settings as you would use for an email client but the administrator may need to add special settings to allow emails to be sent from your `support` and `no-reply` email addresses.

### Why is the test emails not being sent successfully?

Your SMTP email settings are incorrect or the mail server is refusing emails coming from your Moodle site. Read the whole communications dialogue that is displayed when you send a test message. It will often provide some hint of where the problem might be.

### What is the difference between PHP Mail and Moodle SMTP Mail?

If you don't configure the mail settings in Moodle, Moodle will hand off the delivery of email to PHP's built-in mail system. Its settings are typically in your server's PHP.INI file. If you do configure the SMTP settings in Moodle, it will attempt to deliver emails directly to the local SMTP server.

### How can I use this tool to send emails from other email addresses?

You can't. This is to prevent the tool from being used to send spam. If you really must, you can temporarily test the email address of one of the following "From" addresses:

* Your user account
* Support
* No-reply
* Primary admin

### My email used to work in Moodle previous to 3.2. After upgrading to Moodle 3.2 or later, why can't my site send emails?

As of Moodle 3.2, use of the no-reply email address is no longer optional in many cases. You will need to make sure it is now configured correctly. Some mail server may even only permit connections if this is actually a valid email address.

### Why do I see a message about cron not having run for at least 24 hours?

IMPORTANT - See https://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron . If a link is included within the message, clicking it will cause Moodle to try sending queued messages immediately. However, future message will still not be sent automatically. Clicking the link instead of configuring cron will just hide the notice for 24 hours after which it will return until you fix this issue.

If for some reason you are unable to setup an automated cron job and don't see the link, you can enable the link and allow remote running of the cron job by going to Site administration >Security > Site Policies and unchecking **Cron execution via command line only**. For a little extra security, also set a **Cron password for remote access**.

### Why do I see some debugging code in the communications log even though debugging is turned off?

Moodle does some validation before sending an email and can display some useful information so we've enabled some minimal display of debugging information. Informative lines start with **email_to_user**. You can ignore the line number references that follow the information line.

### Regardless of which "from" email address I use, the test email always arrives from the same email address. Why?

This is likely a setting in your mail server. To confirm which email address was used to send the email, look at the bottom of the status message after you try to send the email. If the test email was successfully delivered, you can also try to reply to the test message and take a look at the To email address. There is no need to actually send the reply.

### I am not sure if the problem is with Moodle, my mail server or my firewall. What should I do?

First, the problem is very unlikely to be Moodle. Moodle is used by organization in virtually every country of the world. If there was a problem, someone would have spoken up by now. That said, it could be your email settings. To find out if it is potentially your Moodle settings or firewall, or if it is you mail server, try setting Moodle up to use Gmail as your email server. If it works, it is very likely your email settings. If it doesn't, you might have a firewall blocking email traffic or your email server is incorrectly configured.

### How can I use Gmail to send SMTP emails from Moodle?

Gmail requires that you create an [App Password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) to send email for Moodle.

For more details as well as some of the limitations, see the Moodle documentation on [Email Setup Gmail](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Email_setup_gmail).-

### All the settings seem to be correct. What else can I try?

Despite your best efforts, sometimes you will find that a :port Number needs to be added after the address of the SMTP server. Example: smtp.example.com:587

### Are there any security considerations?

Use of this plugin is restricted to Moodle Site Administrators and allows them to submit an email through a restricted web form that only they can access.
